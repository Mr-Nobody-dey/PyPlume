# TODO list of fixes

1. one config, multiple model/data sources
2. actually add general wind loading
3. make dataset key inferences better
    - also allow keys to be defined
4. allow extrapolation and fix related issues
5. fix anomalies with oversampling gapfiller
6. tear apart plot_features... it's too abstract
