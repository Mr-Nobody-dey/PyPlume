# 2009 Plume Tracker

Source code for Sung Yong Kim's plume tracker, along with Mark's new changes for the Huntington Oil Spill response.

## From the original README

This directory contains code and necessary data developed by Sung Yong
Kim for producing TJ River plume distribution estimates from OI totals.

He set this up to run on ring.ucsd.edu and it was migrated to hfrnet-cs2
on April 1, 2015.  The only operational change made to the code was to
accept either measured or ideal radials, with a priority for measured
when both are available, in generating OI totals.
